# RFC policy - Devices & Mobile (D)Apps

This sub-team will manage the select of sensor/wearable devices compatible wth the network and the building of mobile D/application to save data via.

Device-Mobile RFCs will be managed by the Device-Mobile sub-team, and tagged `Device-Mobile`.

Where there is significant design work for the implementation of a Device or App
feature, the preferred workflow is to submit two RFCs - one for the device
design/firmware and one for the application design.

## Changes which need an RFC

* A new device or upgrade of firmware.
* A new mobile application.
* A new data standard or metadata.


## Changes which don't need an RFC

* Bug fixes, improved error messages, etc.
* Minor refactoring/tidying up

If in doubt it is probably best to just announce the change you want to make to
the compiler subteam on discuss or IRC, and see if anyone feels it needs an RFC.
