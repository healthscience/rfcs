# RFC policy - Decentralize Machine Learning + Flow

This sub-team will manage the building of a Decentralized Machine Learning(DML) and dataflow middle wear to manage the compute and aggregation of training models.

DML-flow RFCs will be managed by the Device-Mobile sub-team, and tagged `DML-Flow`.

Where there is significant design work for the implementation of a component or libary or
feature, the preferred workflow is to submit a RFCs -

## Changes which need an RFC

* Type of ML algorithm compatible with the network.
* Techniques to aggregate training models on decentralized network.
* New messaging or scripting languages to facilitate DML.

## Changes which don't need an RFC

* Bug fixes, improved error messages, etc.
* Minor refactoring/tidying up

If in doubt it is probably best to just announce the change you want to make to
the compiler subteam on discuss or IRC, and see if anyone feels it needs an RFC.
