# RFC guidelines - ResolutionHealth & Simulations

# Motivation
This sub-team will manage the select of ResolutionHealth & Simulations compatible wth the network and the building of visualisation infrastructure called computational scaffolding.

ResolutionHealth & Simulations RFCs will be managed by the Resolution-Simulations sub-team, and tagged `Resolution-Simulations`.

Where there is significant design work for the implementation of a visualisation or simulation, the preferred workflow is to submit a RFCs -

## Changes which need an RFC

* A new computational scaffolding data structure.
* A new visualisation technique.
* A new simulation technique.


## Changes which don't need an RFC

* Bug fixes, improved error messages, etc.
* Minor refactoring/tidying up

If in doubt it is probably best to just announce the change you want to make to
the compiler subteam on discuss or IRC, and see if anyone feels it needs an RFC.
