# RFC guidelines - PtoP network sub-team

# Motivation
This sub-team will manage the selection of peer to peer protocols for data storage, compute and to provide proof of evidence on the science. This sub-team will guide the integration of all protocols used on he network .

ptopnetwork RFCs will be managed by the Device-Mobile sub-team, and tagged `Ptop-Network`.

Where there is significant design work for the implementation of a new PtoP protocol or
feature, the preferred workflow is to submit a RFCs -

## Changes which need an RFC

* A new data storgage protocol.
* A new compute protocol.
* A new science evidence protocol.


## Changes which don't need an RFC

* Bug fixes, improved error messages, etc.
* Minor refactoring/tidying up

If in doubt it is probably best to just announce the change you want to make to
the compiler subteam on discuss or IRC, and see if anyone feels it needs an RFC.
